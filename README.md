### Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the website to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

- W3C Markup Validator- page 1,2,3. ![htmlvalidation-page-1](/assets/media/htmlvalidation-page-1.png)



![htmlvalidation-page-2](/assets/media/htmlvalidation-page-2.png)





![htmlvalidation-page-3](/assets/media/htmlvalidation-page-3.png)

* W3C CSS Validator ![cssvalidation](/assets/media/cssvalidation.png)


* Accesibility

I confirmed that the colors of the fonts have a good contrast with their background makes it easy to read.
On transparent sections the same applies with the contrast.
